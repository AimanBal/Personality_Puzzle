# Personality Puzzle: MBTI Personality Identifier

Project Status: Completed | Focus: Web Application Development and Data Mapping

---

## Project Overview

"Personality Puzzle" is an interactive web application designed to determine a user's personality type based on the 16 established Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personalities. Users input their preferences via a simple questionnaire, and the system instantly maps these choices to the corresponding four-letter MBTI type.

This project demonstrates proficiency in front-end logic and data processing to create an engaging and functional user experience.

## Key Features

* Interactive Questionnaire: Allows users to easily input their preferences across the key dichotomies (e.g., Introversion vs. Extroversion).
* 16 MBTI Mapping: Contains the complete logic and data mapping for all 16 MBTI personality types.
* Instant Results: Provides immediate display of the calculated four-letter MBTI type upon completion of the questionnaire.
* Clean, User-Friendly Interface: Built for an intuitive experience, making the process of discovering one's personality simple and engaging.

## Technical Stack and Implementation

### Technical Stack
* Front-End: HTML5, CSS3
* Logic: JavaScript (used for handling user input, calculating the four-letter code, and displaying results based on the MBTI data model).

### Implementation Details
* Data Mapping: The core of the application uses JavaScript to process user responses and assign a score to each of the four MBTI dichotomies:
    * E/I (Extraversion/Introversion)
    * S/N (Sensing/Intuition)
    * T/F (Thinking/Feeling)
    * J/P (Judging/Perceiving)
* The final personality type (e.g., INTJ, ESFP) is determined by selecting the highest-scoring preference within each pair.
